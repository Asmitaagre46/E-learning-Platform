I created a fully functional e-learning platform using HTML and CSS with a focus on clean design, responsive layout, and intuitive user experience. The goal of the project was to simulate the structure of a real-world educational platform, showcasing how content can be organized and presented effectively for learners.

The platform is divided into multiple sections, including a homepage, course listing, course details, and a contact page. The homepage provides a welcoming introduction with a clear call to action, engaging visuals, and a concise explanation of the platformâ€™s purpose. It sets the tone for a smooth and user-friendly navigation experience.

The course listing section displays available courses in a grid layout, with each course card featuring a title, description, image, and a link to view more details. I used HTML to structure the content and CSS to style each component, incorporating hover effects and consistent spacing to improve interactivity and visual appeal.

The course details page offers in-depth information about each course, including topics covered, instructor details, duration, and learning objectives. This section is designed to help users easily understand what each course offers before making a selection.

Navigation is handled through a fixed header menu that allows users to quickly jump between different sections of the site. The layout is responsive, achieved using CSS Flexbox and media queries, ensuring optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. The contact section includes a simple, styled form for user inquiries or feedback.

In terms of design, I focused on using a modern and minimal aesthetic. A consistent color palette, readable fonts, and well-structured spacing helped achieve a professional look. I also ensured accessibility by using semantic HTML tags and maintaining good contrast across elements.

This project greatly enhanced my understanding of front-end web development, particularly in building multi-page layouts, handling responsive design, and creating visually cohesive user interfaces using only HTML and CSS.
